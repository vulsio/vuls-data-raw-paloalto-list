			"value": "Palo Alto Networks has become aware of a remote code execution vulnerability in the Bash shell utility.  This vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271) allows for remote code execution through multiple vectors due to the way Bash is often used on linux systems for processing commands.   Additional information can be found here:  http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/650\n\nSuccessful attack requires that a user be able to add environmental variables to the bash environment.  This is possible only for PAN-OS users that successfully authenticate to PAN-OS via SSH.  Exploitation does not directly result in root access to the device, as injected commands are run with the OS privileges of the logged in user.  Critical PAN-OS data is only writeable by the root user.\nThis issue affects This issue affects PAN-OS and Panorama 5.0.14 and earlier; 5.1.9 and earlier; 6.0.5 and earlier; and 6.1.0 and earlier."
