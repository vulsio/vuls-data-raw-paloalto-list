	"problem": [
		{
			"lang": "en",
			"value": "An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability exists in Cortex XSOAR SAML authentication that enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker with specific knowledge of the Cortex XSOAR instance to access protected resources and perform unauthorized actions on the Cortex XSOAR server."

			"lang": "en",
			"value": "This issue impacts:\nCortex XSOAR 5.5.0 builds earlier than 1578677;\nCortex XSOAR 6.1.0 builds earlier than 1578663;\nCortex XSOAR 6.2.0 builds earlier than 1578666.\n\nAll Cortex XSOAR instances hosted by Palo Alto Networks are protected from this vulnerability; no additional action is required for these instances.\n"

		{

			"value": "To completely prevent this issue from being exploited before you can upgrade your Cortex XSOAR server, disable SAML authentication integration.\n\nYou can also restrict network access to the Cortex XSOAR server to allow only trusted users to further reduce the impact of this issue."
