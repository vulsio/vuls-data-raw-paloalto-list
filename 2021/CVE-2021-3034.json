		{
			"lang": "en",
			"value": "An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Cortex XSOAR software where the secrets configured for the SAML single sign-on (SSO) integration can be logged to the '/var/log/demisto/' server logs when testing the integration during setup.\n\nThis logged information includes the private key and identity provider certificate used to configure the SAML SSO integration."

			"lang": "en",

		{

Clear the server system logs using the instructions provided in the Workarounds and Mitigations section to remove any potentially logged secrets."

	"work_around": [
		{
			"lang": "en",
			"value": "You must configure a new private key for SAML SSO integration and you should not run integration testing functions until after you complete the Cortex XSOAR upgrade.\n\nYou must clear all server system log files located in the '/var/log/demisto/' directory. There may be several files in this directory, including the server.log file and other archived server logs.\n\nYou can clear all server system logs by stopping the server and running the 'rm /var/log/demisto/server*.log' command from the console."
