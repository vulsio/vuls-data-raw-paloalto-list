	"problem": [
		{
			"lang": "en",
			"value": "A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR agent on Windows platforms that enables an authenticated local Windows user to execute programs with SYSTEM privileges.\n\nThis requires the user to have the privilege to create files in the Windows root directory or to manipulate key registry values."

			"lang": "en",
			"value": "This issue impacts:\nCortex XDR agent 5.0 versions earlier than Cortex XDR agent 5.0.11 on Windows;\nCortex XDR agent 6.1 versions earlier than Cortex XDR agent 6.1.8 on Windows;\nCortex XDR agent 7.2 versions earlier than Cortex XDR agent 7.2.3 on Windows;\nAll versions of Cortex XDR agent 7.2 without content update release 171 or a later version on Windows.\n"
