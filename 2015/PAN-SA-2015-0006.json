			"lang": "en",
			"value": "An issue has been identified in PAN-OS that prevents old management API keys for local administrator accounts from being invalidated upon password change until the device is rebooted. This issue can create a period of time during which an administrator changes the account password, thus creating a new API key, but the old API key is still valid until device reboot.\nThis issue affects the management interface of the device. Network security best practices suggest administering security devices from an out-of-band network, reducing the exposed attack surface.\nThis issue affects PAN-OS versions prior to PAN-OS 7.0.2 and PAN-OS 6.1.7"
