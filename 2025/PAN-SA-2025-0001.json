			"value": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Palo Alto Networks Expedition migration tool enable an attacker to read Expedition database contents and arbitrary files, as well as create and delete arbitrary files on the Expedition system. These files include information such as usernames, cleartext passwords, device configurations, and device API keys for firewalls running PAN-OS software.\n\n\nExpedition, previously known as the Migration Tool, is a free tool that facilitates migration to the Palo Alto Networks NGFW platform from other firewall vendors and provides a temporary workspace for optimizing Palo Alto Networks security policies. Expedition is designed to only be used temporarily for migration purposes, not to be run in production. You do not need it to operate any Palo Alto Networks products or services. Expedition reached its End of Life (EoL) date on December 31, 2024. Please use the suggested alternatives listed in the Expedition End of Life Announcement (https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/expedition-articles/important-update-end-of-life-announcement-for-palo-alto-networks/ta-p/589642).\n\nThese issues do not otherwise impact firewalls, Panorama appliances, Prisma Access deployments, or Cloud NGFWs."
