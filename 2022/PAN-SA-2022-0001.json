	"problem": [
		{
			"lang": "en",
			"value": "An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR agent that enables a local user to learn the cryptographic hash of the supervisor password when generating support files on a deployed agent.\n\nAn attacker must crack the supervisor password hash to make unauthorized changes to the local Cortex XDR agent. This issue has no security impact if the attacker cannot crack the supervisor password hash.\n\nThis issue is fixed in Cortex XDR agent 7.4.1 and all later agent versions. The impact of this issue is significantly mitigated with the use of a secure supervisor password."

	"work_around": [
		{
			"lang": "en",
			"value": "You should ensure that the Cortex XDR agent supervisor password is as complex as possible to make it infeasible for an attacker to crack and to mitigate the impact of this issue. Cortex XDR Server can enforce minimum password complexity requirements to ensure sufficiently secure passwords are used."
