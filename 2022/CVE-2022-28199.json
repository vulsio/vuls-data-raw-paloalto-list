			"value": "The Palo Alto Networks Product Security Assurance team evaluated the NVIDIA Dataplane Development Kit (DPDK) vulnerability (CVE-2022-28199) as it relates to our products.\n\nThis vulnerability causes networking stacks that use the NVIDIA distribution of the DPDK to enter an unrecoverable state when processing traffic and results in a denial-of-service (DoS) to the network interface.\n\nPalo Alto Networks VM-Series (virtual) firewalls that have an enabled NVIDIA network interface card use the affected NVIDIA DPDK module on PAN-OS 10.1 and later versions of PAN-OS software but there are no scenarios that enable successful exploitation of this vulnerability in PAN-OS software. As a result, this vulnerability has no security impact on these firewalls.\n\nThis issue does not impact Palo Alto Networks PA-Series (hardware) firewalls, VM-Series (virtual) firewalls, CN-Series (container) firewalls, Panorama virtual appliances, Panorama M-Series appliances, Cloud NGFW customers, or Prisma Access customers.\n\nTo reiterate, there is no known security impact for this vulnerability in PAN-OS software."
