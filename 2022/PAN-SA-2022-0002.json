			"lang": "en",
			"value": "The Palo Alto Networks Product Security Assurance team is aware of a technique that can enable a local administrator to tamper with the Windows registry to disable the Cortex XDR agent on devices running a Windows operating system.\n\nAs a result, critical Windows system services would not be available and normal usage of the device would be disrupted. Please note, the device must be rebooted for this to take effect.\n\nThis issue does not have a net security impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system. The local Windows administrator is able to disrupt normal usage of the device without this technique.\n"
