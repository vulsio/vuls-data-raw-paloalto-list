			"value": "This issue affects the web-based management interface of PAN-OS and is strongly mitigated by following best practices for securing the management interface of PAN-OS. Our best practices guidelines reduce the exposure of the management interface to potential attackers. We recommend that the management interface be isolated and strictly limited only to security administration personnel through either network segmentation or using the IP access control list restriction feature within PAN-OS.  Please review the Best Practices for Securing Administrative Access in the PAN-OS technical documentation, available at: https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-admin/getting-started/best-practices-for-securing-administrative-access.html."
