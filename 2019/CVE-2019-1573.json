			"value": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the GlobalProtect App for Windows and macOS (VU#192371).\nSuccessful exploitation of this issue would allow a local authenticated attacker to access authentication and/or session tokens and replay them to spoof the VPN session and gain access as the user. An attacker should have already compromised the end user account and gained the ability to inspect memory in order to obtain these tokens.\n\nThis issue affects GlobalProtect App 4.1.0 for Windows and GlobalProtect App 4.1.10 and earlier for macOS. GlobalProtect App for macOS 5.0 is NOT affected."
